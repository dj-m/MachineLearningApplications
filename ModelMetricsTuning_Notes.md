# Machine Learning Applications #

**Process**

- Determine the proper **model** (evaluation) **metric** to use based on the type of response variable & business problem to-solve.
  - Additionally, how to communicate the model's performance to stakeholders.
- Determine the optimal tuning of your model's **hyperparameter**.
  - You set the value of a hyperparameter prior to training your model to determine its _learning process_.
